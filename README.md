# Udacity Full Stack Nanodegree - Log-Analysis Project

## Project Overview

For this project, we're working with the scenario that we've been hired onto a team working on a newspaper site. I've been asked to build an internal reporting tool that will use information from the database to discover what kind of articles the site's readers like, and other statistics.

## How to Run?

#### Required Software:
* [Python3](https://www.python.org)

### Setup database:
1. Download the mock database file.
2. Unzip the file, which contains newsdata.sql.
3. Place the file in your desired directory.
4. Load the data in a local database: psql -d news -f newsdata.sql

### Running the report:

Run the file ``` internal_report_01.py ```
